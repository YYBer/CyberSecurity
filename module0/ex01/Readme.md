What is a CSRF vulnerability?
What Is Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and How Does It ...
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces authenticated users to submit a request to a Web application against which they are currently authenticated. CSRF attacks exploit the trust a Web application has in an authenticated user.

Is CSRF same as XSS?
CSRF and XSS are different in several ways. First, CSRF relies on the user's browser to send a request to the target site, while XSS relies on the user's browser to execute code from the attacker's site. Second, CSRF does not require the attacker to compromise the target site, while XSS does.

leak in teh index.html:
No CSRF Token: The form does not include a CSRF token to prevent CSRF attacks. CSRF tokens are typically generated server-side and included in forms as hidden input fields. When the form is submitted, the server verifies the CSRF token to ensure that the request originated from the same site.

CORS Issue: The fetch request to http://localhost:8070/balance might encounter a Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) issue if the server running on port 8070 doesn't allow requests from the origin of this page. This could lead to errors in fetching the balance.

Insecure Data Transmission: The application uses fetch to communicate with the server, but it doesn't specify any security measures like HTTPS. This could lead to data transmission over an insecure channel.

Missing Error Handling: While the JavaScript code has error handling for fetching the balance and submitting the form, it might be beneficial to have additional error handling for other potential issues.

Lack of Input Validation: There's no client-side or server-side input validation implemented. This could potentially lead to various vulnerabilities, such as injection attacks or data manipulation.

Hardcoded Endpoint URLs: The endpoint URLs (http://localhost:8070/balance and /transfer) are hardcoded in the JavaScript code. It's generally better to use relative URLs or configure them dynamically.
